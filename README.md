NSURLSession, JSON, Mantle, SDWebImage

This project demonstrates usage of [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) to make it easier to deal with JSON data
retrieved from the web. Application uses [kinopoisk.cf](http://kinopoisk.cf/) website as a backend (which provides data
similar to original [Kinopoisk](http://www.kinopoisk.ru/) website). App already loads today films to table view and
displays data in custom table view cells. For images it uses [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).
Here you also can find a blank view controller for movie detail page, you can enrich this project by adding mor content 
about movie to detail page (film crew, sample shots etc).
